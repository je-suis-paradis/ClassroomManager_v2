# ClassroomManager

Assignment for the "C# 101-Fundamentals" course I'm completely immersed in
at the moment. 

The app runs... however, there's this annoying detail that I can't seem to
work out. It has to do with the student data not showing up after 
running lectures. FRUH-STRAH-ZIONE. MASS-EE-MALE.

I'll catch ya later, string concatinator.


PEACE,
p-nut
